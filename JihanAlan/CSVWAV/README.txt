Basically, this program takes in some input CSV that represents data from an audio inputs.

From there, it converts this data into a wav file that should be playable.

The wav file here is built from the program using a sample single note buzzer sound.

There are some customizations that are needed in the code depending on various factors such as sample rate and data input type (float or int, depends on data input)

This is still a WIP
