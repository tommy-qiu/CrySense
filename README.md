# CrySense
The project brings together undergraduate students, graduate students and a professor who are working together to design and implement a product called Crysense. Crysense is a machine learning project that uses machine learning and embedded microcontrollers to accurately detect, classify and interpret different types of baby cries, providing real-time alerts to parents when their baby is crying and what it communicates. Crysense's machine learning technology also means that the system can adapt and improve over time. As the system processes more data and learns from its experiences, it can become even more accurate and helpful for parents. The project aims to develop an innovative baby monitoring system that has the potential to improve the lives of parents and babies alike. Overall, Crysense represents a powerful tool for parents who want to stay on top of their baby's needs and ensure that they are providing the best possible care, and has the potential to make a significant difference for parents.
